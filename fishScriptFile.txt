>? defines 3 variables (can make any number of these) (also they can use math!)
>& number num = 1+1*2
>& number othernum = 7.0
>& number thirdnum = 4

>? you can also use word variables (strings)
>& word hello = hello world
>$ print @ Prints string variable:
>$ print & hello
>$ print @

>? prints out these 3 variables

    >$ print & num
    >$ print & othernum
    >$ print & thirdnum
    >$ print @
    >? btw tabs don't do anything I just like how they look
