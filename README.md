# FishScript
This is the code for website that demonstrates my programming language.

FishScript is an object oriented, strongly typed language based around the > symbol.
It is not intended to be strictly practical, and instead is designed as a unique language with a different approach to syntax.

The code is highlighted and formatted by codemirror, and is run by an array based branching if tree programmed in JS.
